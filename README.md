# Story
The inspiration for "TouchWizards" emerged from the scarcity of split-screen multiplayer games, particularly on mobile platforms. The project aimed to revive the enjoyable experience of multiplayer gaming. "TouchWizards" offers a wizard-themed duel, where players can challenge their friends to engage in magical battles.

# What
"TouchWizards" is a mobile game that allows players to step into the shoes of a wizard and cast powerful spells. The game offers three distinct modes:

Single Player (vs. AI): Challenge AI-controlled opponents in thrilling battles.
Local Multiplayer: Engage in epic wizard duels with friends on the same device.
Online Multiplayer (Work in Progress): Connect with players worldwide and prove your wizardry skills in online battles.
# How
Development Tools: "TouchWizards" was developed using Unity and the C# programming language.
UI Animation: The project utilized "Dotween" for UI animations.
Collaboration: Unity Collab and GitHub were instrumental for effective collaboration among the team members.
Task Management: Trello was used for task management and project organization.
# Challenges
Feature Overload: The initial vision for "TouchWizards" involved adding numerous features to stand out in the market. However, this approach resulted in an overloaded game with no clear focus. The team had to rethink and streamline the core features of the game.

AI Development: Crafting an AI opponent for the single-player mode posed a considerable challenge. The team had to imitate player movements and actions, considering various scenarios. This experience opened the door to the world of artificial intelligence in game development.

# Result
"TouchWizards" represents the team's second game development endeavor, built upon the feedback and lessons learned from their first project. The introduction of the single-player mode required the development of an AI opponent, expanding their skills into the realm of artificial intelligence.

Through this project, the team gained valuable insights into task and time management, external library integration, and asset management.
